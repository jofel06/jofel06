Hey, I'm Christian Jofel, but you can call me CJ or whatever you prefer.. :)
I am a BSIT Graduate. 
I'm currently learning Automation testing, both in using Java and Python as the programming Language. I am also using Selenium as the Webdriver.

This is a page where I upload and share some small automation test projects that I'm doing and practicing. :D
